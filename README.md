# InventAI Unity Library

The InventAI Unity Library enables developers to generate 3D models and images directly within Unity using AI. Create game assets from scratch with prompts and art presets (universe, art style, genre, etc.), or modify existing assets to transform the look and feel of your game in minutes. This library is powered by the InventAI SDK and can dramatically speed up asset creation and iteration for Unity projects.
